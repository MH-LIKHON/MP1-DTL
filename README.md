## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a responsive, user-friendly website that effectively communicates the services offered by Deluxe Transportation. The website aims to attract potential customers by showcasing the fleet, services, and contact information.

### User Stories
1. **New User Goals**:
    - I want to understand what services the company offers.
    - I want to easily find contact information to book a service.
    - I want to see the fleet of vehicles available for hire.

2. **Returning User Goals**:
    - I want to quickly access booking options.
    - I want to stay updated on new services or changes in offerings.

3. **Frequent User Goals**:
    - I want to contact the company directly through the website.
    - I want to download the company brochure or CV.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The website uses a professional colour palette of dark greys, whites, and accent colours like orange and blue to create a clean, modern look.

#### Typography
Two fonts, **Roboto** and **Exo**, are used throughout the website to maintain a balance between readability and style.

#### Imagery
High-quality images of the fleet and services are used to engage the user and convey a sense of luxury and professionalism.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created to plan the layout of the site across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). These wireframes served as a blueprint for the website's responsive design.
