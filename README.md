## Project Overview

Deluxe Transportation is a static front-end website designed to present useful information to users about luxury transportation services. This project was developed as part of the User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. The site is intended to meet both the user's needs and the site owner's goals, providing a clear, professional, and accessible user interface.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a responsive, user-friendly website that effectively communicates the services offered by Deluxe Transportation. The website aims to attract potential customers by showcasing the fleet, services, and contact information.

### User Stories
1. **New User Goals**:
    - I want to understand what services the company offers.
    - I want to easily find contact information to book a service.
    - I want to see the fleet of vehicles available for hire.

2. **Returning User Goals**:
    - I want to quickly access booking options.
    - I want to stay updated on new services or changes in offerings.

3. **Frequent User Goals**:
    - I want to contact the company directly through the website.
    - I want to download the company brochure or CV.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The website uses a professional colour palette of dark greys, whites, and accent colours like orange and blue to create a clean, modern look.

#### Typography
Two fonts, **Roboto** and **Exo**, are used throughout the website to maintain a balance between readability and style.

#### Imagery
High-quality images of the fleet and services are used to engage the user and convey a sense of luxury and professionalism.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created to plan the layout of the site across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). These wireframes served as a blueprint for the website's responsive design.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
The website was manually tested across various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

1. **Navigation**: 
    - Tested all links in the navigation bar to ensure they direct to the correct pages.
    - Verified that the navbar is responsive on mobile devices.

    - Checked that the layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes, ensuring all content is accessible.

    - Tested all contact links (email, phone, social media) to ensure they open the correct apps or pages.

### Validation
- **HTML Validation**: The HTML code was validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **CSS Validation**: The CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

### Bugs and Fixes

- **Bug 1**: **Navigation bar not collapsing on mobile devices.**
  - **Fix**: Adjusted the Bootstrap classes to ensure the collapse functionality works without JavaScript.

- **Bug 2**: **Footer overlapping content on smaller screens.**
  - **Fix**: Added appropriate padding to ensure the footer stays at the bottom of the page.

- **Bug 3**: **Video background in the hero section not displaying full width.**
  - **Fix**: Used Bootstrap's grid system and CSS adjustments to ensure the video background covers the entire width of the screen across different device sizes.

- **Bug 4**: **Button styling in the hero section not matching the requested yellow color.**
  - **Fix**: Updated the CSS to apply the correct yellow background color (`#f8c146`) and appropriate hover effects to the button.

- **Bug 5**: **"Stay in Touch" text in the footer not properly aligned.**
  - **Fix**: Adjusted the padding and positioning in the CSS to ensure the "Stay in Touch" text and icons have consistent spacing and are properly aligned.

- **Bug 6**: **Hero section video not playing or not fitting correctly.**
  - **Fix**: Reorganized the HTML structure for the hero section, added a full-width container for the video background, and ensured the video is responsive across all device sizes.

- **Bug 7**: **Issues with the hero section video alignment.**
  - **Fix**: Used `object-fit` and Bootstrap's grid system to center the video and ensure it scales correctly while maintaining the desired layout.

- **Bug 8**: **Video background in the hero section positioned incorrectly, sitting in the bottom right corner.**
  - **Fix**: Used `position-absolute`, `top: 50%`, `left: 50%`, and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` to center the video and ensure it covers the entire section.

- **Bug 9**: **Hero section video height extending beyond the desired area, affecting the layout.**
  - **Fix**: Removed `height: 100vh;` and ensured the video scales correctly with `object-fit: cover` to maintain the proper aspect ratio.

- **Bug 10**: **"Book Now" button in the hero section not performing the same action as the submit button.**
  - **Fix**: Replaced the `<a>` tag with a `<button>` tag and added `onclick="alert('Service not enabled');"` to trigger the same alert as the submit button.

- **Bug 11**: **Content in the hero section not fading in sequentially.**
  - **Fix**: Added CSS animations using keyframes and `animation-delay` to create a staggered fade-in effect for the `<h1>`, `<p>`, and button elements.

- **Bug 12**: **Buttons not centered or sized appropriately in the contact form.**
  - **Fix**: Used Bootstrap's `d-flex`, `justify-content-center`, and `btn-sm` classes to center the buttons and make them smaller for a better layout.
